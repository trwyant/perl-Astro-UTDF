DESCRIPTION

This package contains a class to read data formatted in Universal
Tracking Data Format (UTDF) and return the data in a set of objects
whose accessors return various fields of the individual records, and
selected data computable from these fields.

This is ALPHA CODE. Among other things, this means that there are NO
functional tests whatever, and the public interface is NOT stable.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by your favorite CPAN client, or by either
of the two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf Astro-UTDF-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf Astro-UTDF-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm file into the Astro/ directory (creating it if necessary) in
the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
