=head1 NAME

Astro::UTDF - Manipulate Universal Tracking Data Format data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Astro::UTDF;
 my @data = Astro::UTDF->slurp( $file_name );
 foreach my $utdf ( @data ) {
     print join( "\t", $utdf->decode( 'measurement_time' ),
         $utdf->azimuth(), $utdf->elevation(),
     ), "\n";
 }

=head1 NOTICE

This code should be considered alpha software. It was written without
access to the full specification, and has been exposed to a B<very>
limited set of honest-to-Heaven UTDF data (the data in the test suite
are artificial). The wise user will perform his or her own tests on this
code, since it may produce results other than those intended by either
author or user.

=head1 DETAILS

This class represents a record from a Universal Tracking Data Format
(UTDF) file. The UTDF file can be read using the
L<< Astro::UTDF->slurp()|/slurp >> method, which returns a list of
Astro::UTDF objects.

=head1 METHODS

Most of the following methods are accessor/mutators of some sort. When
called with no argument, they return the desired value. When called with
an argument, they set the value from the argument, and return the object
so that calls can be chained. Validation is minimal to non-existent, and
data range problems seem to be most likely to show up when calling
L<< $utdf->raw_record()|/raw_record >> as an accessor.

This class supports the following public methods:

=head2 new

 my $utdf = Astro::UTDF->new( raw_record => $buffer );

This method instantiates an Astro::UTDF object. You can pass name/value
pairs, where the name is the name of a mutator and the value is the
value to pass to it. If you pass no arguments, you get an object with
all attributes initialized to 0, except:

 front is initialized to its predefined value;
 router is initialized to '  ';
 tdrss_only is initialized to 18 null bytes;
 rear is initialized to its predefined value.

=head2 agc

 print 'AGC is ', $utdf->agc(), "\n";

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the value of the AGC signal level at the receiver.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
value of the AGC signal level at the receiver.

This information comes from bytes 39-40 of the record.

=head2 azimuth

 print 'Azimuth is ', $utdf->azimuth(), " radians\n";
 $utdf->azimuth( 1.23098 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the antenna azimuth in radians, in the range 0 <= azimuth <= TWO_PI. If
L</enforce_validity> is true, this method returns C<undef> if
L</is_angle_valid> (bit 2 (from 0) of the L</data_validity> attribute)
is false.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
antenna azimuth to the angle given (in radians) in its argument. The
angle will be normalized before storage. Setting the azimuth does not
set is_angle_valid( 1 ); you must do this yourself.

This information comes from bytes 19-22 of the record.

=head2 clone

 my $clone = $utdf->clone();

This method returns a new object whose attributes are the same as those
of the object cloned. Be aware that this means
C<< $clone->prior_record() >> returns the same object as
C<< $utdf->prior_record() >> until you change one of them.

You can pass name/value pairs as arguments, in which case the names are
the names of mutator methods, and the arguments are arguments to them.
The mutators are called on the clone, not the original object.

If you call this as a static method, it is equivalent to L<new()|/new>.

=head2 data_interval

 printf 'Data interval = ', $utdf->data_interval(), " seconds\n";
 $utdf->data_interval( 1 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the data interval in seconds, from bits 0-10 (from 0) of
L</tracker_type_and_data_rate>. It is possible to get fractions of a
second.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
data interval in seconds. The argument must not be negative.

=head2 data_validity

 printf "Data validity is 0x%02x\n", $utdf->data_validity();

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the data validity mask.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
data validity mask.

The bits of the data validity mask (from bit 0 = least significant) are:

 0 - range valid
 1 - range rate valid
 2 - angle valid
 3 - angle delta correction ( 1 = corrected )
 4 - refraction correction to angles ( 1 = corrected )
 5 - refraction correction to range, rate ( 1 = corrected )
 6 - destruct range rate ( 1 = destruct )
 7 - side lobe ( 1 = side lobe )

This information comes from byte 51 of the record.

=head2 decode

 print 'Measurement time: ',
 $utdf->decode( 'measurement_time' );

This method is a general-purpose accessor, producing human-readable
output when it knows how.  It takes as its arguments the name of a
method, and its arguments if any. If this method knows how to produce
human-readable output from the given method, it does so and returns the
human-readable output. Otherwise it simply calls the method and returns
its output.

This method knows how to produce human-readable output from the
following methods. Generally, the output comes pretty much verbatim from
the description of the given method's output.

 data_validity (in hexadecimal)
 frequency_band
 frequency_band_and_transmission_type (in hexadecimal)
 front (in hexadecimal)
 measurement_time ( = scalar gmtime )
 mode (in hexadecimal)
 raw_record (in hexadecimal)
 rear (in hexadecimal)
 receive_antenna_diameter_code
 receive_antenna_geometry_code
 tdrss_only (in hexadecimal)
 tracking_mode
 transmission_type
 transmit_antenna_diameter_code
 transmit_antenna_geometry_code

=head2 doppler_count

 print 'Doppler count is ', $utdf->doppler_count(), "\n";
 $utdf->doppler_count( 123456789 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the Doppler count. If L</enforce_validity> is true, this method return
C<undef> if L</is_doppler_valid> (bit 1 (from 0) of the
L</data_validity> attribute) is false.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
Doppler count to the number given in its argument.  Setting the Doppler
count does not set is_doppler_valid( 1 ); you must do this yourself.

This information comes from bytes 33-38 of the record.

=head2 doppler_shift

 print 'Doppler shift is ', $utdf->doppler_shift(), " Hertz\n";

This method returns the Doppler shift of the data, in Hertz.

This information is calculated from the biased Doppler frequency, which
in turn comes from the difference between the Doppler counts of this
record and the previous record (accounting for count wrap if needed),
divided by the difference between the observation times of this record
and the previous record. Accordingly, this information is not available
for the first record in the file.

If L</enforce_validity> is true, this method returns C<undef> if
L</is_doppler_valid> (bit 1 (from 0) of the L</data_validity> attribute)
of either of the two records involved is false.

Assuming both Doppler counts are valid, the Doppler shift in Hertz is

 +-               -+
 | N1 - N0         |
 | ------- - 2.4e8 | / M
 | T1 - T0         |
 +-               -+

where the C<N>s are the Doppler-plus-bias counts, the C<T>s are the
corresponding times, and the C<M> is the frequency-dependent factor
returned by the L</factor_M> method.

=head2 elevation

 print 'Elevation is ', $utdf->elevation(), " radians\n";
 $utdf->elevation( 0.65321 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the antenna elevation in radians, in the range -PI <= elevation < PI. If
L</enforce_validity> is true, this method returns C<undef> if
L</is_angle_valid> (bit 2 (from 0) of the L</data_validity> attribute)
is false.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
antenna elevation to the angle given (in radians) in its argument. The
angle will be normalized before storage. Setting the elevation does not
set is_angle_valid( 1 ); you must do this yourself.

This information comes from bytes 23-26 of the record.

=head2 enforce_validity

 print "Validity is ", $utdf->enforce_validity() ?
     " enforced\n" : " not enforced\n";
 $utdf->enforce_validity( 1 );

When called without an argument this method is an accessor, returning
the current value of the enforce_validity attribute.

When called with an argument this method is a mutator, setting the value
of the enforce_validity attribute and returning the mutated object.

The enforce_validity attribute is not part of the UTDF standard. If set
true (in the Perl sense, meaning any value but C<undef>, C<''> or C<0>),
those methods which return data having associated validity bits will
return C<undef> if the relevant validity bit is not set. If false, those
methods will ignore the validity bit and return whatever value the
attribute has.

This attribute defaults to C<undef> (that is, false).

=head2 factor_K

 print "Factor M is ", $utdf->factor_K(), "\n";
 $utdf->factor_K( 100 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor, returning
the factor C<K> to be used in the calculation of L</range_rate>.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator, specifying the
value of factor C<K> to be used in the calculation of L</range_rate>.

By default, this is 240/221 if the frequency is >= 2e9 Hertz, and 1
otherwise. Setting the value to C<undef> restores the default.

=head2 factor_M

 print "Factor M is ", $utdf->factor_M(), "\n";
 $utdf->factor_M( 100 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor, returning
the factor C<M> to be used in the calculation of L</doppler_shift>.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator, specifying the
value of factor C<M> to be used in the calculation of L</doppler_shift>.

By default, this is 100 if the frequency is >= 1.2e10 Hertz, and 1000
otherwise. Setting the value to C<undef> restores the default.

=head2 frequency_band

 printf "Frequency band is 0x%01x\n",
     $utdf->frequency_band();
 $utdf->frequency_band( 3 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the frequency band encoded as a number from 0 to 15.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
frequency band to a number from 0 to 15; this number comes from the low
4 bits of the argument.

The frequency band is found in the high nybble of the
L</frequency_code_and_transmission_type>, and the encoding is documented
there.

=head2 frequency_band_and_transmission_type

 printf "The frequency band and transmission type are 0x%02x\n",
     $utdf->frequency_band_and_transmission_type();
 $utdf->frequency_band_and_transmission_type( 0x11 );

When called without an argument, this method is an accessor returning
the frequency band and transmission type.

When called with an argument, this method is a mutator which sets the
frequency band and transmission type.

This field represents two data items packed into a byte. The most
significant nybble encodes the frequency (in hexadecimal) as follows:

  0 - unspecified
  1 - VHF
  2 - UHF
  3 - S-band
  4 - C-band
  5 - X-band
  6 - Ku-band
  7 - visible
  8 - S-band uplink/Ku-band downlink
  9-F - unused

The least significant nybble encodes the transmission type (in
hexadecimal) as follows:

  0 - test
  1 - unused
  2 - simulated
  3 - resubmit
  4 - real time (normal setting)
  5 - playback

This information comes from byte 52 of the record.

The file will be put into C<binmode> and read to the end. Astro::UTDF
objects will be constructed from each of the records in the file, and
returned in the order they were read. All records but the first will
have their L</prior_record> attribute set to the previous record read.

You can also pass name/value pairs. These will be passed as arguments to
L<new()|/new> when the objects are created. If a value for an attribute
normally read from the file is specified, the given value will override
the value from the file.

If the number of arguments is odd, the first argument is taken to be the
file name or handle. You can also specify the file name or handle
explicitly with C<< Astro::UTDF->slurp( file => $file_name ); >>.

This method ignores the value of L</is_last_frame>.
