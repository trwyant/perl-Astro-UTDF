=head1 NAME

My::Module::Meta - Information needed to build Astro::UTDF

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use lib qw{ inc };
 use My::Module::Meta;
 my $meta = My::Module::Meta->new();
 use YAML;
 print "Required modules:\n", Dump(
     $meta->requires() );

=head1 DETAILS

This module centralizes information needed to build C<Astro::UTDF>. It
is private to the C<Astro::UTDF> package, and may be changed or
retracted without notice.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods:

=head2 new

 my $meta = My::Module::Meta->new();

This method instantiates the class.

=head2 build_requires

 use YAML;
 print Dump( $meta->build_requires() );

This method computes and returns a reference to a hash describing the
modules required to build the C<Astro::UTDF> package, suitable for
use in a F<Build.PL> C<build_requires> key, or a F<Makefile.PL>
C<< {META_MERGE}->{build_requires} >> or C<BUILD_REQUIRES> key.

=head2 distribution

 if ( $meta->distribution() ) {
     print "Making distribution\n";
 } else {
     print "Not making distribution\n";
 }

This method returns the value of the environment variable
C<MAKING_MODULE_DISTRIBUTION> at the time the object was instantiated.

=head2 requires

 use YAML;
 print Dump( $meta->requires() );

This method computes and returns a reference to a hash describing
the modules required to run the C<Astro::UTDF>
package, suitable for use in a F<Build.PL> C<requires> key, or a
F<Makefile.PL> C<PREREQ_PM> key. Any additional arguments will be
appended to the generated hash. In addition, unless
L<distribution()|/distribution> is true, configuration-specific modules
may be added.

=head2 requires_perl

 print 'This package requires Perl ', $meta->requires_perl(), "\n";

This method returns the version of Perl required by the package.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class has no public attributes.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 MAKING_MODULE_DISTRIBUTION

This environment variable should be set to a true value if you are
making a distribution. This ensures that no configuration-specific
information makes it into F<META.yml>.
