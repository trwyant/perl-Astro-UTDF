  Corrected conversion of azimuth and elevation values to radians.
  Make the following accessors into accessor/mutators: frequency_band(),
    is_angle_valid(), is_doppler_valid(), is_range_valid(),
    tracker_type() and transmission_type().
  Add accessor/mutator is_last_frame().
  Add hex_record() as accessor/mutator wrapping raw_record().
  Recode slurp() in terms of new( raw_record => $buffer, ... ). You can
    pass slurp() attribute_name/value pairs to override those read from
    the file.
  Make raw_record() a mutator as well as an accessor. As mutator, it
    sets the values of all attributes contained in the UTDF record. As
    accessor it constructs the record out of the attribute values.
  Add methods new() and clone(). Both take attribute_name/value pairs as
    arguments.
  Have accessors that are not (yet) mutators croak when given an
    argument.
  Added dependency on Params::Util (for prior_record() validation).
  Added method prior_record() to retrieve or set the prior record for
    the purpose of computing Doppler shift. Doppler shift is now
    computed on demand using prior_record().
  Removed caching of computed results.
  Added functionality test t/utdf.t.
  Angle, range delay and doppler methods now return data even if the
    relevant valid bit is not set, unless enforce_validity() is true.
  Add accessor/mutator enforce_validity().
